               <h4>Introduction</h4>
               <p><strong>Tyler Gregory Okonoma</strong> (born March 6, 1991), known by his stage name Tyler The Creator, is an American rapper, producer, and video driector. He waas formerly the leader of the Americana rap collective, Odd future. The group raised in prominence due to the group's boldness and unnatural prescence in the music scene at the time. Members, such as Earl Sweatshirt aand Frank Ocean are other popular figures, deriving from this group. However, this uncanny charisma in each of the defining characteristics would come into countless controversies.</p>
